### Information Technology

Information Technology is all forms of tech used to create, store, exchange, and store information.
* Structured (.csv format)
* Unstructured (audio, image, video)
    * Financial reports, tiktok videos, mouse cursor (eyeball movement) on screen
* IT is a **general-purpose technology (GPT)** which has an impact on all aspects of production and invention in the economy.
    * Steam engines and electricity are the first two GPTs.

### Information Systems
Information Systems (IS) is combintion of technology (what) people (who) and process (how) that an organization uses to produce and manage information.

* 1953, Arthur Andersen (Accenture) asked to automate payroll processing and manufacturing at GE's facility in Louisville, KT
* Installation of UNIVAC I computer and printer resulted in first commercially owned system in 1954.

### What Increases Reliance on IT?
* __IT Supply__: Availability of resources and services drives reliance on technology
  * Cheaper and faster, [Moore's Law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moore%27s_law)
* __Demand for IT__: Growing demand for technology solutions fuels IT reliance
  * IT substitutes/enhances labor

### Increasing strategic importance of IS/IT
* Efficiency and effectiveness improvement
  * IT needed to enhance operational efficiency/effectiveness
* Customer Demands
  * Increasing customer expectations on products & services drive adoptino of IT solutions
* Regulations
  * Compliance with regulations necessitates IT systems systems for data manageemnt and security

|Qualities | Effects          
|----------|------------------|
|Price | + Efficient Firm        
|Price, Quality | + Quality Firm   
|Price, Quality, Choice, Delivery Time | + Flexible Firm  
|Price, QUality, Choice, Delivery Time, Uniqueness | + Unique Firm    

### Strategic Importance of IT to Businesses
* A source of opportunites
  * Enabling redefinition of industries, markets, firms, and their strategies
  * Changes in concepts like time and distance
* Source of risk
* No part of a business is unaffected by IT

### IT Value
IT value is the measurable benefits and contributions that IT assets, services, projects, and initiatives provide to the organization.
> "The world's most valuable resource is no longer oil, but data" - the Economist, 2017

Data's different from oil since it has zero marginal cost to replicate, is easy to scale, and doesn't have any rivalry. Most IT spending is intangible (cannot be properly measured).
